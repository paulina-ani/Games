In this repository I present interactive games solutions

Properties:

justify-content - aligns items within the main axis and
accepts the following values: flex-start, flex-end, center,
space-between, space-around;

align-items - aligns items with cross axis and accepts 
the following values: flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline,
stretch

align-content - set how multiple lines are spaced apart from
each other. This may be confusing, but align-content determines
the spacing between lines, while align-items determines how
the whole items are aligned within the container. It takes the
following values: flex-start; flex-end; center; space-between;
space-around; stretch (lines are stretched to fit the container)

flex-direction - defines the direction items are placed 
in the container, and accepts the following values:
row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse

order - property to individual items. By default, items have a value
of 0, but we can use this property to set it to a positive or negative integer v$

align-self - apply to individual item and accepts the same values 
as align-items

flex-wrap - spread out the items and accepts the following
values: nowrap, wrap, wrap-reverse

flex-flow - the combination of flex-direction and flex-wrap, e.g.
flex-flow: row wrap.
